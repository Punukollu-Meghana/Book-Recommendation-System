Methodology:

Data Collection: A dataset of books with their titles, ratings, and other metadata is collected.
Data Preprocessing: The data is preprocessed by creating a new column to categorize the ratings into bins.
Feature Engineering: The data is transformed into a format suitable for the recommendation algorithm by creating a matrix of book features.
Nearest Neighbors Algorithm: The Nearest Neighbors algorithm is used to find the most similar books to a given book.
Recommendation Generation: The algorithm generates a list of recommended books based on the nearest neighbors.
Key Features:

User Input: The user is prompted to enter a book title to get recommendations.
Recommendation Generation: The system generates a list of recommended books based on the user's input.
Rating-Based Recommendations: The system recommends books based on their ratings.
Technologies Used:

Python: The programming language used to build the system.
Pandas: A library used for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: A library used for machine learning algorithms.
NumPy: A library used for numerical computations.
Outcome:

Book Recommendations: The system generates a list of recommended books based on the user's input.
Improved User Experience: The system provides users with personalized book recommendations, improving their reading experience.
Overall, this project demonstrates a basic book recommendation system that uses a nearest neighbors algorithm to generate recommendations based on book ratings.
